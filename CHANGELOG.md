### v5.8.0 - Frets on Fire Easter Egg + iOS Visualizer Fixes
- **Frets on Fire**: New Guitar Hero-style rhythm game easter egg
  - Search "fire" or "frets" in Library to discover
  - **SuperFlux-inspired algorithm**: Uses moving maximum + moving average for accurate onset detection
  - **BPM detection**: Auto-detects tempo and quantizes notes to actual beat grid (16th notes)
  - **Pitch-based lane assignment**: Spectral centroid tracks melody - notes follow the song's pitch contour
  - **Hybrid lane logic**: Bass/kick hits use frequency bands, melodic content uses pitch tracking
  - **Album art in track selection**: See album covers when choosing which track to play
  - **5-fret gameplay** with theme-derived colors (hue shifts from your primary color)
  - Keyboard controls: 1-5 or F1-F5 on desktop, tap lanes on mobile
  - **Real audio decoding**: FFmpeg on Linux/desktop, native AVFoundation on iOS
  - Scoring matches original Frets on Fire: 50 pts per note, max 4x multiplier (at 30 combo)
  - BPM-based timing windows (tighter at higher BPMs, like original)
  - Charts cached for instant replay, supports 3+ hour DJ sets (caps at 3000 notes)
  - **Profile stats**: Total songs, plays, notes hit, best score with track name displayed in fire-themed card
  - **"Rock Star" Milestone**: Unlock a badge with game controller icon for discovering the easter egg
- **iOS Visualizer Decay Fix**: Increased decay factor for iOS (0.25 vs 0.12) so spectrum/mirror bars properly fall back down
- **iOS Native FFT**: Buffer pre-allocation and native throttling for smooth Essential Mix visualizer
- **iOS Audio Decoder**: New native plugin for decoding audio files to PCM for chart generation

### v5.7.8 - iOS Native FFT Critical Performance Fix
- **Native FFT Buffer Reuse**: Pre-allocate all FFT buffers once (was allocating 40KB+ per audio callback causing GC pressure)
  - 8 arrays totaling ~40KB now allocated once at init, reused every frame
  - Eliminates memory allocation in the hot path completely
- **Native FFT Throttling**: Added ~30fps throttle at native level (was sending 40-50 events/sec before Dart throttle)
  - Skips processing entirely when emitting too fast
  - Reduces event channel flooding
- **Pre-computed Hanning Window**: Window function computed once at init (was recreated every callback)
- **Asymmetric Smoothing**: Essential Mix visualizer now uses fast attack (0.6) / slow decay (0.12) matching fullscreen visualizers
  - Was using single 0.18 factor for both (too slow on attack, too fast on decay)
  - Visualizer now reacts instantly to beats and fades smoothly
- **Result**: Essential Mix visualizer should now be smooth AND reactive on iOS

### v5.7.5 - iOS Visualizer Performance Overhaul
- **Essential Mix iOS Performance**: Complete performance overhaul for smooth playback on iOS
  - **Critical Fix**: FFT updates now use ValueNotifier instead of setState - only visualizer rebuilds, not entire screen

  - Visualizer uses ValueListenableBuilder for isolated 30fps updates
  - Position updates throttled to 4/sec on iOS (was ~10/sec)
  - Artwork shadow reduced (blur 20 vs 40, spread 4 vs 10)
  - Play button shadow reduced (blur 10 vs 20)
  - Scrubber shadows removed entirely on iOS
  - Waveform repaint tolerance added (0.2% threshold)
- **Spectrum Bars iOS Portrait**: Fixed height scaling to 80% in portrait mode (was using broken width-based formula)
- **Mirror Bars iOS Portrait**: Fixed height scaling to 80% in portrait mode (was using broken width-based formula)
- **Spectrum Bars Performance**: Added tolerance-based shouldRepaint (0.005 threshold)
- **Mirror Bars Performance**: Added tolerance-based shouldRepaint, HSL color caching, gradient shader caching
- **Waveform Painter Optimization**: Cached Paint objects instead of creating new ones per bar

### v5.7.4 - Essential Mix Enhanced Visualizer & iOS Performance
- **Gradient Bar Colors**: Visualizer bars now use theme-based gradient colors (hue shifts ±40° around your primary color)
- **Glow Effect**: Soft blur glow behind bars for a premium neon look
- **Bass Pulse Ring**: Sonar-style pulsing ring on bass hits (nautical theme)
- **Double Ring on Heavy Bass**: Second outer ring appears on strong bass hits
- **iOS Visualizer Throttling**: FFT updates throttled to ~30fps, preventing lag
- **RepaintBoundary Isolation**: Visualizer and waveform isolated to prevent cascading repaints
- **Portrait Mode Clipping Fix**: Visualizer fits within container bounds
- **Pre-computed Geometry**: Trig values and weights computed once, reused every frame
- **Reduced Bar Count on iOS**: 32 bars on iOS vs 48 on desktop for smoother animation
