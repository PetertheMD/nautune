- **Critical iOS Fix**: Essential Mix visualizer now properly responds to music on iOS
  - Root cause: `IOSFFTService.instance.initialize()` was never called (Essential Mix uses its own AudioPlayer, not AudioPlayerService)
  - `setAudioUrl()` and `startCapture()` were silently returning early due to uninitialized service
- **Seek Fix**: FFT shadow player now syncs position when seeking in Essential Mix (was stopping after seek)
- **Low Power Mode Fix**: Both fullscreen and Essential Mix now properly disable visualizer

- **iOS Native FFT**: Buffer pre-allocation and native throttling for smooth Essential Mix visualizer
- **iOS Audio Decoder**: New native plugin for decoding audio files to PCM for chart generation

### v5.7.8 - iOS Native FFT Critical Performance Fix

  - 8 arrays totaling ~40KB now allocated once at init, reused every frame
  - Eliminates memory allocation in the hot path completely
- **Native FFT Throttling**: Added ~30fps throttle at native level (was sending 40-50 events/sec before Dart throttle)
  - Skips processing entirely when emitting too fast
  - Reduces event channel flooding
- **Pre-computed Hanning Window**: Window function computed once at init (was recreated every callback)
- **Asymmetric Smoothing**: Essential Mix visualizer now uses fast attack (0.6) / slow decay (0.12) matching fullscreen visualizers
  - Was using single 0.18 factor for both (too slow on attack, too fast on decay)
  - Visualizer now reacts instantly to beats and fades smoothly
- **Result**: Essential Mix visualizer should now be smooth AND reactive on iOS

### v5.7.5 - iOS Visualizer Performance Overhaul
- **Essential Mix iOS Performance**: Complete performance overhaul for smooth playback on iOS

- **Mirror Bars Performance**: Added tolerance-based shouldRepaint, HSL color caching, gradient shader caching
- **Waveform Painter Optimization**: Cached Paint objects instead of creating new ones per bar

### v5.7.4 - Essential Mix Enhanced Visualizer & iOS Performance
