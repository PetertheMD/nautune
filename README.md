## 🧪 Review / Demo Mode

Apple's Guideline 2.1 requires working reviewer access. Nautune includes an on-device demo that mirrors every feature—library browsing, downloads, playlists, CarPlay, and offline playback—without touching a real Jellyfin server.

1. **Credentials**: leave the server field blank, use username `tester` and password `testing`.
2. The login form detects that combo and seeds a showcase library with open-source media. Switching back to a real server instantly removes demo data (even cached downloads).
3. Demo mode is documented in `assets/demo/README.md`, which also lists licensing notes for the bundled tracks and artwork.

### Demo assets recap

- Streaming samples (bundled MP3s for demo mode only):
  - `assets/demo/demo_online_track.mp3` – “Ocean Vibes” from Pixabay (track: https://pixabay.com/music/beats-ocean-vibes-391210/ · Pixabay License).
  - `assets/demo/demo_offline_track.mp3` – “Sirens and Silence” from Pixabay (track: https://pixabay.com/music/modern-classical-sirens-and-silence-10036/ · Pixabay License). This file also powers the offline/download view so reviewers see a real track in airplane mode.
- Artwork: intentionally uses the shared fallbacks `assets/no_album_art.png` and `assets/no_artist_art.png`, making it easy to drop in a branded placeholder that demo + production both inherit.

## 🎨 Key Components

### Now Playing Bar (`lib/widgets/now_playing_bar.dart`)
- **Waveform Progress Strip**: Tinted Jellyfin waveform with a synthetic fallback when the server can't provide one
- **Scrub Anywhere**: Drag the waveform or slider to seek instantly
- **Mini Controls**: Play/Pause/Stop/Skip buttons always accessible
- **Tap to Expand**: Opens the full-screen player

### Library Screen (`lib/screens/library_screen.dart`)
- **Albums Tab**: Grid view with infinite scroll support, album artwork
- **Artists Tab**: Full artist browser with discography navigation
- **Search Tab**: Search albums inside the selected library, displaying artist attribution and year
- **Favorites Tab**: Recent and favorited tracks in a list
- **Playlists Tab**: Your Jellyfin playlists with full management (create, edit, delete, add/remove tracks)
- **Bottom Navigation**: Material `NavigationBar` mirrors the tab order for quick access on mobile and desktop

### Playlist Detail Screen (`lib/screens/playlist_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Track List**: View all tracks in a playlist with play functionality
- **Remove Tracks**: Individual track removal with ❌ button
- **Edit/Rename**: Toolbar button to rename playlist
- **Delete**: Toolbar button to delete entire playlist

### Audio Player Service (`lib/services/audio_player_service.dart`)
- Manages playback lifecycle and queues
- Prioritises direct-play URLs with adaptive fallback to Jellyfin transcoding
- Auto-saves position every second and restores on launch
- Configures native audio session for optimal performance

### Playback State Persistence
- **Complete Session Restoration**: Full playback state saved and restored
  - ✅ Current track, position, queue, album context
  - ✅ Repeat mode (off/all/one) and shuffle state
  - ✅ Volume level and UI preferences (library tab, scroll positions)
  - ✅ Show/hide volume bar preference
- **Smart Restoration**: Automatically resumes from last position on app launch
- **Intelligent Queue Handling**:
  - ✅ **Pause saves queue**: Pausing preserves queue for next session
  - ✅ **Stop clears queue**: Stop button intentionally clears everything (fresh start)
  - ✅ **App resume**: Background/foreground restores playback exactly where you left off
- **Real-time Saving**: Position saved every second for accurate resume
- **Stored in Hive**: Persists across app restarts and force-closes via fast, local storage

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Flutter/Dart lints**: Enforced by `analysis_options.yaml`. Run `flutter analyze` before committing.
2. **Write tests**: Add unit/widget tests for new features. Run `flutter test`.
3. **Keep UI declarative**: Centralize styling in `lib/theme/nautune_theme.dart`.
4. **Jellyfin integration**: Keep all API logic in `lib/jellyfin/`. Expose state via `NautuneAppState`.
5. **Graceful error states**: Show loading spinners, error messages, and retry buttons.
6. **Document complex flows**: Add inline comments for non-obvious logic.
7. **Commit frequently**: Use descriptive commit messages. Sync via SSH.

## 🤝 Contributing & Collaboration

1. **Feature branches**: Work on branches, open PRs against `main` with screenshots/demos
2. **Coordinate platform changes**: Discuss desktop shortcuts, CarPlay hooks early
3. **Code reviews**: All PRs require review before merge
4. **Testing**: Ensure builds pass on Linux before pushing
5. **Codemagic**: Note iOS build considerations in PR descriptions
