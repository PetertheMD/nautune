- Deferred `NautuneAppState.initialize()` work and CarPlay setup to run after the first Flutter frame, preventing black-screen hangs caused by plugin initialization failures.
- Hardened startup logging (`Nautune initialization started/finished`) to make it easier to diagnose device issues from Xcode or `flutter logs`.
- CarPlay integrations now match Jellyfin data more accurately by tracking album artist IDs and forwarding precise playback positions to the Jellyfin server.

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements (Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2: 90% Complete!)

Nautune has undergone a major architectural refactoring to improve performance, maintainability, and scalability:

### ✅ Phase 2: Provider Pattern Migration (90% Complete!)

**Goal**: Migrate all screens from parameter-passing to Provider pattern for better state management

**Completed Screens (9/10)**:
1. **SettingsScreen** - Uses SessionProvider + UIStateProvider
2. **QueueScreen** - Uses Provider for audio service access
3. **FullPlayerScreen** - Migrated with didChangeDependencies pattern
4. **AlbumDetailScreen** - Auto-refreshes on connectivity changes
5. **ArtistDetailScreen** - Uses Provider pattern
6. **PlaylistDetailScreen** - Auto-refreshes on connectivity changes
7. **GenreDetailScreen** - Auto-refreshes on connectivity changes
8. **OfflineLibraryScreen** - Clean Provider-based implementation
9. **LibraryScreen (Partial)** - Home tab fully refactored with 6 horizontal shelves

**Remaining**:
- **LibraryScreen (Complete)** - Most complex screen with 7 tabs, final migration pending

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ **Auto-refresh capability**: Detail screens detect connectivity changes and reload automatically
- ✅ **Cleaner constructors**: Screens no longer need appState as parameter
- ✅ **Better testability**: Screens can be tested with mock providers
- ✅ **Reactive updates**: UI automatically rebuilds when state changes
- ✅ **Consistent pattern**: All screens follow same state access approach

### ✅ Download Service Migration to Hive
- **Before**: Entire download database stored as a single JSON string in SharedPreferences
- **After**: Hive-based structured storage with individual record access
- **Impact**: ⚡ Instant save/load even with 1000+ downloads, no more UI jank
- **Migration**: Automatic one-time migration from old format

### ✅ State Management Refactoring
The monolithic `NautuneAppState` (1674 lines) has been split into focused, testable providers:

#### **SessionProvider** (200 lines)
- Handles authentication, login/logout, session persistence
- Independent and unit-testable
- Single responsibility: auth only

#### **UIStateProvider** (120 lines)
- Manages UI-only state (volume bar, crossfade, scroll positions, tab index)
- **Key win**: Toggling volume bar now rebuilds 1 widget instead of 1000+!
- Completely independent from session/data concerns

#### **LibraryDataProvider** (600 lines)
- All library data fetching and caching (albums, artists, playlists, tracks, genres)
- Pagination support for large libraries
- Loading states and error handling
- Depends on SessionProvider for auth context

#### **ConnectivityProvider** (70 lines)
- Network connectivity monitoring
- Provider-compatible wrapper around ConnectivityService

#### **DemoModeProvider** (240 lines)
- Demo mode content and state management
- Isolated from production data
- Coordinates with SessionProvider and DownloadService

### Performance Comparison

| Action | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Toggle volume bar | Rebuild 1000+ widgets | Rebuild 1 widget |
| Save downloads | Encode ALL downloads to JSON | Save only changed data to Hive |
| Test auth logic | Impossible (god object) | Easy (SessionProvider unit test) |
| Fetch albums | Rebuild entire app | Rebuild album list only |

### Benefits
- ⚡ **Performance**: Granular rebuilds, no more full-app updates for UI changes
- 🧪 **Testability**: Each provider can be unit tested independently
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Small focused classes (100-600 lines vs 1674)
- 👨‍💻 **Developer Experience**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to extend
- 🚀 **Future-Proof**: Ready for Phase 2 features (EQ, Lyrics, Scrobbling)

**Status**: Phase 2 (Widget Refactoring) - **90% complete!** 9 out of 10 screens migrated to Provider pattern with auto-refresh capability.

## 🧪 Review / Demo Mode

Apple's Guideline 2.1 requires working reviewer access. Nautune includes an on-device demo that mirrors every feature—library browsing, downloads, playlists, CarPlay, and offline playback—without touching a real Jellyfin server.

1. **Credentials**: leave the server field blank, use username `tester` and password `testing`.
2. The login form detects that combo and seeds a showcase library with open-source media. Switching back to a real server instantly removes demo data (even cached downloads).
3. Demo mode is documented in `assets/demo/README.md`, which also lists licensing notes for the bundled tracks and artwork.

### Demo assets recap

- Streaming samples (bundled MP3s for demo mode only):
  - `assets/demo/demo_online_track.mp3` – “Ocean Vibes” from Pixabay (track: https://pixabay.com/music/beats-ocean-vibes-391210/ · Pixabay License).
  - `assets/demo/demo_offline_track.mp3` – “Sirens and Silence” from Pixabay (track: https://pixabay.com/music/modern-classical-sirens-and-silence-10036/ · Pixabay License). This file also powers the offline/download view so reviewers see a real track in airplane mode.
- Artwork: intentionally uses the shared fallbacks `assets/no_album_art.png` and `assets/no_artist_art.png`, making it easy to drop in a branded placeholder that demo + production both inherit.

### Offline Boot Troubleshooting
- If you previously ran Nautune before the new connectivity boot logic, the cached Hive data may use legacy map types. A `_Map<dynamic, dynamic>` cast error on launch means the cache needs to be cleared.
- Delete the `nautune_cache.*` files in the platform data directory (e.g., Linux: `~/.local/share/nautune/`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/nautune/`, Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\nautune\\`). The app will rebuild the cache automatically on the next successful sync.
- After clearing the cache, you can start the app offline—ConnectivityService will detect the missing network and the Library screen will immediately show downloads.

### State Management Evolution

**Before (Legacy)**:
- `app_state.dart`: 1674-line god object managing everything
- Every state change rebuilds the entire app

**After (Phase 1)**:
- **5 focused providers** with single responsibilities
- Granular rebuilds (only affected widgets update)
- Easy to test and maintain
- Clear separation of concerns

See **Architecture Improvements** section above for details!

## 🎨 Key Components

### Now Playing Bar (`lib/widgets/now_playing_bar.dart`)
- **Waveform Progress Strip**: Tinted Jellyfin waveform with a synthetic fallback when the server can't provide one
- **Scrub Anywhere**: Drag the waveform or slider to seek instantly
- **Mini Controls**: Play/Pause/Stop/Skip buttons always accessible
- **Tap to Expand**: Opens the full-screen player

### Library Screen (`lib/screens/library_screen.dart`)
- **Albums Tab**: Grid view with infinite scroll support, album artwork
- **Artists Tab**: Full artist browser with discography navigation
- **Search Tab**: Search albums inside the selected library, displaying artist attribution and year
- **Favorites Tab**: Recent and favorited tracks in a list
- **Playlists Tab**: Your Jellyfin playlists with full management (create, edit, delete, add/remove tracks)
- **Bottom Navigation**: Material `NavigationBar` mirrors the tab order for quick access on mobile and desktop

### Playlist Detail Screen (`lib/screens/playlist_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Track List**: View all tracks in a playlist with play functionality
- **Remove Tracks**: Individual track removal with ❌ button
- **Edit/Rename**: Toolbar button to rename playlist
- **Delete**: Toolbar button to delete entire playlist
- **Play Queue**: Play individual tracks or queue entire playlist

### Audio Player Service (`lib/services/audio_player_service.dart`)
- Manages playback lifecycle and queues
- Prioritises direct-play URLs with adaptive fallback to Jellyfin transcoding
- Auto-saves position every second and restores on launch
- Configures native audio session for optimal performance

### Playback State Persistence
- **Complete Session Restoration**: Full playback state saved and restored
  - ✅ Current track, position, queue, album context
  - ✅ Repeat mode (off/all/one) and shuffle state
  - ✅ Volume level and UI preferences (library tab, scroll positions)
  - ✅ Show/hide volume bar preference
- **Smart Restoration**: Automatically resumes from last position on app launch
- **Stop Clears State**: Pressing stop resets persistence to default (clean slate on next launch)
- **Real-time Saving**: Position saved every second for accurate resume
- **Stored in SharedPreferences**: Persists across app restarts and force-closes

## 🐛 Known Issues

- CarPlay testing requires physical device or iOS Simulator with CarPlay window

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Flutter/Dart lints**: Enforced by `analysis_options.yaml`. Run `flutter analyze` before committing.
2. **Write tests**: Add unit/widget tests for new features. Run `flutter test`.
3. **Keep UI declarative**: Centralize styling in `lib/theme/nautune_theme.dart`.
4. **Jellyfin integration**: Keep all API logic in `lib/jellyfin/`. Expose state via `NautuneAppState`.
5. **Graceful error states**: Show loading spinners, error messages, and retry buttons.
6. **Document complex flows**: Add inline comments for non-obvious logic.
7. **Commit frequently**: Use descriptive commit messages. Sync via SSH.

## 🤝 Contributing & Collaboration

1. **Feature branches**: Work on branches, open PRs against `main` with screenshots/demos
2. **Coordinate platform changes**: Discuss desktop shortcuts, CarPlay hooks early
3. **Code reviews**: All PRs require review before merge
4. **Testing**: Ensure builds pass on Linux before pushing
5. **Codemagic**: Note iOS build considerations in PR descriptions
