## 🧪 Review / Demo Mode

Apple's Guideline 2.1 requires working reviewer access. Nautune includes an on-device demo that mirrors every feature—library browsing, downloads, playlists, CarPlay, and offline playback—without touching a real Jellyfin server.

1. **Credentials**: leave the server field blank, use username `tester` and password `testing`.
2. The login form detects that combo and seeds a showcase library with open-source media. Switching back to a real server instantly removes demo data (even cached downloads).
