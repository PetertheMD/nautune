## 🧪 Review / Demo Mode

Apple's Guideline 2.1 requires working reviewer access. Nautune includes an on-device demo that mirrors every feature—library browsing, downloads, playlists, CarPlay, and offline playback—without touching a real Jellyfin server.

1. **Credentials**: leave the server field blank, use username `tester` and password `testing`.
2. The login form detects that combo and seeds a showcase library with open-source media. Switching back to a real server instantly removes demo data (even cached downloads).

## 🔧 Development

### Run in Debug Mode
```bash
flutter run -d linux --debug
```

### Build Release
```bash
flutter build linux --release
```

### Build Deb Package (Linux)
```bash
# Requires: dart pub global activate fastforge
fastforge package --platform linux --targets deb
```

### Static Analysis
```bash
flutter analyze
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

| Feature | Platform | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Desktop Remote Control | iOS → Linux | 🔜 Planned |
| Additional Visualizers | All | ✅ Complete |

- **Desktop Remote Control**: Control desktop playback from iOS device over local network.
