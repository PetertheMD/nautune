# Nautune 🎵🌊

Poseidon's cross-platform Jellyfin music player. Nautune is built with Flutter and delivers a beautiful deep-sea themed experience with smooth native audio playback, animated waveform visualization, and seamless Jellyfin integration.

## 🚀 Latest Updates
- Reworked iOS bootstrap with a shared `FlutterEngine`, SceneDelegate, and Info.plist scene manifest so `flutter_carplay` can launch reliably on CarPlay-equipped head units (see `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`, `SceneDelegate.swift`, and `Info.plist`).
- Deferred `NautuneAppState.initialize()` work and CarPlay setup to run after the first Flutter frame, preventing black-screen hangs caused by plugin initialization failures.
- Hardened startup logging (`Nautune initialization started/finished`) to make it easier to diagnose device issues from Xcode or `flutter logs`.
- CarPlay integrations now match Jellyfin data more accurately by tracking album artist IDs and forwarding precise playback positions to the Jellyfin server.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Infinite scrolling needs backend pagination support
- CarPlay testing requires physical device or iOS Simulator with CarPlay window

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Flutter/Dart lints**: Enforced by `analysis_options.yaml`. Run `flutter analyze` before committing.
2. **Write tests**: Add unit/widget tests for new features. Run `flutter test`.
3. **Keep UI declarative**: Centralize styling in `lib/theme/nautune_theme.dart`.
4. **Jellyfin integration**: Keep all API logic in `lib/jellyfin/`. Expose state via `NautuneAppState`.
5. **Graceful error states**: Show loading spinners, error messages, and retry buttons.
6. **Document complex flows**: Add inline comments for non-obvious logic.
7. **Commit frequently**: Use descriptive commit messages. Sync via SSH.

## 🤝 Contributing & Collaboration

1. **Feature branches**: Work on branches, open PRs against `main` with screenshots/demos
2. **Coordinate platform changes**: Discuss desktop shortcuts, CarPlay hooks early
3. **Code reviews**: All PRs require review before merge
4. **Testing**: Ensure builds pass on Linux before pushing
5. **Codemagic**: Note iOS build considerations in PR descriptions
